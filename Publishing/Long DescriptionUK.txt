Stuck in a room with no door just a computer, four raven statues and a letter box. Can you decode the cryptic letters and escape the puzzle prison?

In this game, you use two main commands: "Walk To" and "Interact With". You will need to use these commands in conjunction with the clues in the letters to find your way out of the room.
The game autosaves after each milestone so you can stop playing and come back at any point.

Commands:
"Play" -> Starts playing the game
"Walk To [Subject]" -> Moves your character towards the subject
"Interact with [Subject]" -> You character will use the subject in some way
"Read Letter" -> Alexa will read aloud the letter
"Repeat" -> Alexa describes your current situation, useful if you get a bit confused
"Help" -> Alexa will tell you some commands you can use
"Restart" -> The game restarts anew
"Stop" -> Ends the session with the game but keeps the autosave active for when you return

To play, first, the enable this skill and then say "Alexa play Puzzle Prison".
